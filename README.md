## 🚀 Key Features

* 🤖 **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction**
  Leverages user-input symptoms to predict likely diseases.

* 🧠 **Ensemble of Machine Learning Models**
  Combines Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes classifiers for robust predictions.

* 📝 **NLP-Driven Symptom Matching**
  Utilizes natural language processing techniques to ensure resilient and context-aware symptom interpretation.

* 📊 **Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics**
  Built-in utilities for validating accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

* 💊 **Treatment Recommendations**
  Provides basic prescription suggestions aligned with the predicted condition.

* 📈 **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**
  Includes a preconfigured notebook for exploratory analysis and demonstration.

* 🖼️ **Modern UI with Streamlit**
  Intuitive, responsive user interface for seamless interaction.
